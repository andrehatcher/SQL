-- For this analysis, I used a database containing multiple tables to query data regarding the customers and orders.

-- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iPhone"
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum

JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS febsales

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND((SUM(Quantity)*price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101; how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), ROUND((SUM(Quantity)*price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS febsales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
